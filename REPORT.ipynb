    "During the summer break, two earthquakes of around 5.0 magnitude occurred in my hometown (Anhui, China). As someone who experienced an earthquake for the first time, this event sparked my interest in studying earthquakes. This curiosity led me to focus my project on seismology. While reviewing various materials, I became particularly intrigued by the study of earthquakes along the Pacific Ring of Fire. The tectonic activity in this region is complex, and it is the primary location for over 90% of the world's earthquakes. Therefore, studying this area is of significant importance for future seismological research. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my project, I stated the hypothesis that locations where relatively large earthquakes have occurred in the past 30 days are more likely to experience further seismic activity in the future. Throughout the process of creating this project, I encountered numerous challenges, raised many questions, and conducted further reflections. But overall, I learned a lot."
